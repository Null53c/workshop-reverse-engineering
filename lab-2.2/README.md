# Lab 2.2 : Intercept requests via the Chrome Devtools Protocol

## Background

Intercepting, inspecting, and modifying inbound and outbound communication is a critical part of any reverse engineering effort.

## Goal

Use the Chrome Devtools Protocol directly to intercept all Script resources, log the URL to the terminal, and then continue the request.

## Hints

1. The Puppeteer API is fantastic : http://bit.ly/puppeteer-api 
2. As are the Chrome Devtools Protocol docs : http://bit.ly/chrome-devtools-protocol
2. This is purely in the `Network` domain
3. Remind me to flip back to the pseudo-code if you're stuck.
