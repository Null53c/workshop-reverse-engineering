# Lab 2.1 : Programmatically control a browser with Puppeteer

## Background

Web application analysis needs to be completely automated, otherwise everything depending on a manual step risks breaking when anything changes.

## Goal

Set up a base environment that controls Chrome with Puppeteer and nodejs.

## Hints

1. The Puppeteer API is fantastic : http://bit.ly/puppeteer-api 
2. You need to get a `browser` instance from `puppeteer`
3. You need to get a `page` instance from `browser`
4. You need to *go to* a url of your choice, e.g. https://example.com
